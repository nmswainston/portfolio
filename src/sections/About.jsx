        I've spent years working in home automation and AV – building and
        supporting smart homes, networks, and systems where things just have to
        work. That mix of tech, troubleshooting, and working with real people is
        what pulled me into frontend development.
      </p>
      <p className="copy">
        Now I focus on building UIs that are simple to use, easy to maintain,
        and grounded in solid HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I like projects where I
        can own the front end, connect it to APIs or automation tools, and ship
        something that actually makes someone's day easier.
      </p>
      <p className="copy">
        I'm currently looking for opportunities where I can grow as a front-end
        engineer, work with designers and product teams, and bring AI and
        automation into the toolbelt when it makes sense.
